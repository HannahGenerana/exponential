# Exercise 15: Write a function called exponent(base, exp) that returns an int value of base raises to the power of exp.
# Note here exp is a non-negative integer, and the base is an integer.

# pseudocode

# create a function called exponent 
def exponent (base, exp):

# calculate the result when the base is raise to exp
    result = base ** exp
    
# conditions
   # check if the exp is equal to 0

   # check if the exp is less than 0

# print the result
